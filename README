This is the code to complete Michigan State's EGR100 project 2
All the code is original except for line 400 which came from stack overflow 
because I was having a hard time sorting a dictionary with string keys
and tuples of objects. While I am familiar with using lambda expressions
it was new for me to use a lambda expression in order to sort a dictionary,
cool!

At the end of the day this project was less about EGR100 and more about me
challenging myself in a program that was out of my skill level.

Totally spaghetti code. Do not open the file if you cringe at gross code
